<p>There have been numerous contests going on lately leading up to the release of Windows 7, and I was lucky enough to win one of them! If you’re interested in taking a look at the current contests, be sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/WindowsGamer">@WindowsGamer</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/MSWindows">@MSWindows</a>.</p>  <p> </p>  <p>First of all, a picture of the keyboard (Logitech G15) I’m replacing:</p>  <p><a title="G15" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40571704@N05/3949165167/"><img border="0" alt="G15" src="http://static.flickr.com/3513/3949165167_d7abe76bda.jpg" /></a></p>  <p> </p>  <p>Here’s the new keyboard (Sidewinder X6):</p>  <p><a title="X6" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40571704@N05/3949188291/"><img border="0" alt="X6" src="http://static.flickr.com/2427/3949188291_4712e8a18d.jpg" /></a></p>  <p> </p>  <p>Some general thoughts so far:</p>  <ul>   <li>I miss my LCD – Not many games or programs support it, but it is useful when they do</li>    <li>The volume knob on the X6 doesn’t seem very responsive</li>    <li>The X6 keys took some getting used to, but I prefer the feel of them over the G15</li>    <li>The moveable number pad seems nice – When I’m gaming I don’t need it, so it makes sense to use it for macros instead</li>    <li>I’d prefer a Windows key on the right side as well, but I can deal with it. I’ve also found myself hitting F1 instead of Esc due to the altered placement</li>    <li>The X6 is lacking USB ports, though I thankfully have some convenient ones on my monitor </li> </ul>  <p>Overall, I’m a big fan of the X6 so far and I’ll definitely get used to the differences. The main thing I’ll miss is the LCD, though I suppose <a href="http://www.ventrilo.com/">Ventrilo</a> was one of the few apps I used it for. I’ll definitely keep using the X6 as my primary keyboard as I do prefer the feel of the keyboard over the G15 – Thanks again <a href="http://twitter.com/WindowsGamer">@WindowsGamer</a>!</p>  <p> </p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40571704@N05/sets/72157622319253497/">Keyboard Gallery</a></p>
